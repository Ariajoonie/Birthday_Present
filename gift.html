          <p>&#216;GIFTS &#216;</p>
          <ol>
            <li class="content">
             As I've already mentioned that you've been very unresponsive to my texts for past few days,
              and same for my letters, so I decided that instead of a letter I would make a video of things, I want to 
              tell you today. Naah !! don't worry my face is not a part of this gift, instead its from people you "really" love.
              <br/><span>(P.S. THIS WAS MY FIRST TRY AT VIDEO EDITING AND I SUCKED. :) )</span><br/>
              <a href="" target="_blank">VIDEO </a>
            </li>
            <li class="content">
              Any gift I give you would be incomplete if it dosen't has a book . I could have obviously ordered a
              book from amazon or flipkart but since this whole gift is going to be virtual so the book this time 
              is also a pdf (You'll get a real one when the college reopens ;) ). You've been greatly interested in fantasies,
              so I found this amazing fantasy thriller which has girl protagonists.I hope you like it. <br/>
              <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/10E20yIAUOPbn5w1Ll4Z34XgLO8KutwDw/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">BOOK</a>
            </li>
            <li class="content">
              DRUMROLLS   TADA<br/>
              The last but not the least. This is the main virtual gift that I was preparing. I read somewhere that even 
              a plumber has there own website nowadays so, yup I made your personal portfolio/website I tried to make it as 
              near as to what you would have made yourself. Feel free to tell me where do you want changes and everything. 
              I'll do it without asking any question. I hope you use this professionally and personally :) . <br/>

          <span>I know this isn't what you expected and it could have been better , hehe. I'll give you a lot of gifts
            when we meet next. I tried to make it as special as I could. <b>I MISS YOU</b>.
