            As you've been very unresponsive to my messages and hasn't replied to my letters. This letter is going 
            to be very short ðŸ˜¤. Since January I was planning on giving you a nice customized birthday box, but I should tell
            you this you're very unlucky. As I was not able to give you what I thought of, I prepared few virtual gifts
            for you because obviously I wouldn't have let your birthday paas without a celebration UwU. You might or might not
            like these gifts (You won't).  I don't know if this animated background is a disturbance , I hope you can see 
            the pictures clearly. I know you have already guessed some gifts but I alos know you've no idea about your ultimate gift.
            Your only sensible friend besides me is Debasmita ðŸ™‚ rest of them are as useless as you ðŸ™‚. She atleast 
            helped me whenever I asked her. Mark my words you're a pretty vibrant personality Arishmita Mukherjee. 
            Deciding what to give you is much harder than actually arranging for it. Your  dislikes have a very large curve,
            and there is a very small gap in that curve where all your likings exist. That's what I think tho. I hope
            I'm able to gift you on all your upcoming birthdays because not gonna lie, preparing for these gifts has given me 
            more happiness than any of the other things in this quarantine. Why don't you have 3 or 4 birthdays? Sigh, but 
            at the same time I can gift you anytime I want , so don't consider this the end ðŸ˜›. One thing if you read this 
            before all the background animations complete that would really be a bummer so please wait for the cycle to complete. 
            In this process for preparing these gifts I had to make a github profile for you(link in your ultimate gift) . You'll find all the photos, but as I know you're
            very lasy and would probably won't even open your github. You can ask me directly on whatsapp if need be. Umm the hard part,
            I'm sorry Arishmita (You know what for), and I'm not asking you to forgive me or forget about it but I just wanted you to know
            I won't let anything else happen to us in future. I LOVE YOU <br/>
